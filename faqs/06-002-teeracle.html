What is TEEracle?
TEEracle is a service that can be integrated with blockchains to provide <i>oracle</i> services to smart contracts. Smart contracts cannot normally interact with entities outside the blockchain, so oracles provide this off-chain information. TEEracle uses SGX enclaves attested by Attesteer to provide oracles where users can be assured the results are authentic and not manipulated by the oracle.
