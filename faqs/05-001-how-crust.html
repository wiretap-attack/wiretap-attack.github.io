How does Crust store files?
Users upload files to a decentralized network such as IPFS and pay a fee for Crust workers to store the file for a period of time. Crust workers use an SGX enclave to manage data and prove that the file is fully stored and served in unmodified form. The Crust blockchain periodically rewards storage workers with cryptocurrency based on how much data they can prove they are storing. Additionally, all storage space is filled with verifiable random data which ensures the worker truly has the amount of storage it advertises.
