What is interposition? What is an interposer?
An interposer is a link that sits between two electrical interfaces; in our case, between the motherboard and DRAM. We then attach the interposer to a logic analyzer, which is a piece of equipment that allows us to see and record signals passing through the interposer, namely our computer's memory accesses and the data associated with them.
