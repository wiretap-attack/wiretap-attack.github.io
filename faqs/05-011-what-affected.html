What can you do as a malicious storage provider?
As an attacker, we are able to advertise an arbitrarily large amount of free storage, which allows us to accept any storage job. When we accept a storage job, we do not have to truly store the file as we can bypass the proof of storage work with our modified Crust enclave. Because of this, an attacker can claim a file is stored faster than any honest worker, and claim both the initial storage payment and continuous fees without actually doing work.
