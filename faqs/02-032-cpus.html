What CPUs are affected by this? Why are some CPUs affected and not others?
We have tested our attack on 3rd Generation Intel Xeon Scalable Processors. While these support a large Enclave Page Cache (EPC), they also use TME (total memory encryption) for SGX, which itself uses deterministic encryption. </p> <p> Older SGX platforms such as those from Intel's Core and Xeon-E families are not affected, as these use Intel's Memory Encryption (Intel ME) engine, which does not use deterministic memory encryption. However, these platforms also support a much smaller EPC and are about to be deprecated. </p> <p> Next, we are not sure about Xeon-D CPUs, but suspect they also use TME and thus vulnerable to our techniques. Finally, 4th and 5th Generation Intel Xeon Scalable Processors require DDR5 memory, and thus are not vulnerable to our current work. Stay tuned however for more news! ðŸ˜‰
