How did you register with Attesteer as a malicious enclave?
As Attesteer relies on Intel's Quoting Enclave attestation, our attestation key is able to forge attestation quotes to be submitted to an attester. As Attesteer records public keys of trusted services, we are able to register our own arbitrary public key with our forged quote as an SGX enclave.
