What can you do with the cluster and master keys?
With the cluster key, we can decrypt the contents of any transaction sent to the cluster we belong to. We observed that as Phala Network only has a single cluster, this would affect all transactions. With the master key, we can derive all current and future cluster keys, obtaining all transaction data on the network.
