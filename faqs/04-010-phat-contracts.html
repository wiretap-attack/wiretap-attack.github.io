So what can you do with Phat Contracts?
Phat Contracts, unlike normal smart contracts, do not execute directly on the blockchain and instead execute within SGX enclaves. By executing in SGX instead of the blockchain, phat contracts are able to interact with the wider world (such as the internet and other blockchains), along with offering faster compute capabilities. Execution data is kept private within an SGX enclave, and the trusted SGX enclave code ensures the phat contract is executed honestly.
