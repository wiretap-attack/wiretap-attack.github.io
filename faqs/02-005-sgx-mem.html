Wait, isn't SGX memory encrypted?
Yes, but as the memory encryption is deterministic, we are able to build a mapping between encrypted memory and its corresponding unencrypted memory. Although we cannot decrypt arbitrary memory, this encryption oracle is sufficient to break the security of constant-time cryptographic code.
