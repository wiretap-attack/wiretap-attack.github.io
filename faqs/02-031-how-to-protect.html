So what can I do if I want to protect against WireTap?
We emphasize that SGX aims to defend against software attackers, and the party owning the physical SGX hardware must be trusted. We recommend the usage of cloud providers that you trust and that provide independent physical security. WireTap primarily affects parties which allow any entity to be trusted as long as they run SGX hardware.
