What is Intel SGX?
Intel Software Guard eXtensions (SGX) is a set of extensions present in recent Intel server CPUs to provide a hardware-backed Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). In short, even if the server gets hacked and completely taken over, the attacker should still not be able to peek inside SGX and observe the data in it. To that aim, SGX isolates trusted code and resources in spaces known as enclaves, which are protected from attackers with root-level access. As part of the isolation, SGX ensures that software attackers cannot see memory or CPU state of executing enclaves. SGX aims to allow users to run their code and data on remote servers with assurance that computation executes in a trusted manner, and cannot be hacked.
