How practical are these attacks?
We have successfully extracted attestation keys, which are the primary mechanism used to determine whether code is running under SGX. This allows any hacker to masquerade as genuine SGX hardware, while in fact running code in an exposed manner and peeking into your data. We demonstrate concrete security breaks on real-world software utilizing SGX, such as <a href="https://scrt.network/">Secret Network</a>, <a href="https://docs.phala.com/network">Phala</a>, <a href="https://crust.network/">Crust</a>, and <a href="https://www.integritee.network/">IntegriTEE</a>.
