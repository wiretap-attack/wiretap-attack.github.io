Are there mitigations for WireTap? Is SGX secure now?
WireTap is considered by Intel to be outside the threat model, as SGX offers no protections against physical attacks. Thus, there are no current mitigations besides running servers in secure physical environments. At the time of publication SGX running on Scalable Xeon servers is vulnerable to memory interposition attacks and we expect this will remain the case in the foreseeable future.
