What can you do with a malicious Attesteer registration?
This will vary by use case. In one use case, an attacker can access all data sent a worker which correctly passes attestation. In another other case, the attacker can execute off-chain work inauthentically and return arbitrary data to on-chain queries without the user being able to determine that an attacker was involved.
