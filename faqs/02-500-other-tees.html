What about other systems such as Intel TDX or AMD SEV? What about DDR5?
Our work only studies SGX on DDR4 systems. For a similar concurrent work studying both SGX and SEV we invite you to checkout BatteringRAM. However, both SGX and even DDR4 memory is antiquated by now, replaced by newer systems supporting TDX and DDR5. Stay tuned to hear about our work for those systems ðŸ˜‰.
