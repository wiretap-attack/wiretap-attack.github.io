What is attestation?
In the context of Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) such as SGX, attestation is a guarantee that code is running on genuine hardware and is thus protected by it. In SGX, it validates that the hardware running the enclave is made by Intel and is up-to-date, and that a specific enclave was run securely and produced a given output.
