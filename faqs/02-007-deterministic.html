Remind me what deterministic encryption is again?
When encryption is deterministic, a given plaintext and key will result in a fixed ciphertext over every execution. In other words, (for a given key) there is a bijective relationship between inputs and encrypted outputs. Practically speaking, this means if we see a ciphertext value multiple times, we know the corresponding plaintext memory was the same every time. Similarly, if we determine what plaintext a ciphertext value corresponds to, we can always map this value to our known plaintext.
