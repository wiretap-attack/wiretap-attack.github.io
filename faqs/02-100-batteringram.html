I've heard about the <a href="https://batteringram.eu/">BatteringRAM</a> attack, how is this different?
WireTap has a similar effect to <a href="https://batteringram.eu">BatteringRAM</a>, and both teams independently discovered their attacks simultaneously without being aware of each other. Like two sides of the same coin, WireTap and BatteringRAM look at complimentary properties of deterministic encryption. While WireTap focuses mainly on breaching confidentiality, BatteringRAM focuses mostly on integrity. The bottom line is the same however, both SGX and SEV are easy to break using memory interposition.
